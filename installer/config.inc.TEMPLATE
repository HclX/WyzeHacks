# Make your own copy of this file and put it under the root of SD card
# with name "config.inc" when installing the hack.

# You need to modify NFS_ROOT to point to your NFS share. The recordings
# will be stored under $NFS_ROOT/WyzeCams/<MAC_ADDR_OF_YOUR_CAMERA>/.
export NFS_ROOT='192.168.1.10:/volume1/'

# Some NFS configurations may need special mount options. You can specify
# them here. The default value is verified on my camera with a NFS v3 share
# on my home server.
export NFS_OPTIONS='-o nolock,rw,noatime,nodiratime'

# Uncomment and modify the AUTO_REBOOT variable to automatically reboot
# the camera at a specific minute. Time is specified in "HH:MM" format
# in UTC time.
# export REBOOT_AT='13:16'

# Uncomment and modify the ARCHIVE_OLDER_THAN variable to automatically
# archive recording clips and alarm images if it's a certain days older.
# export ARCHIVE_OLDER_THAN=5

# Uncomment the following variable to sync the console log to the camera
# folder in NFS share. Use with caution as the log contains sensitive
# information and will cause your account compromise if leaked.
# export SYNC_BOOT_LOG=1

# In my setup I noticed at some occasions the camera starts rebooting frequently
# which seems to be a result of dropping wifi connections. Running a "ping"
# command in background seems to be solving this issue. Uncomment this variable
# to enable this fix.
# export PING_KEEPALIVE=1

# Uncomment to enable voice notification when NFS network connection lost. The
# value should be in range of 0 and 100

# This changes the default root password to whatever you specified. To
# generate your own password hash, use the following command from a
# linux environment:
#   openssl passwd -1 -salt <YOUR SALT> <YOUR PASSWORD>
# Use the result to replace sample hash ($1$MYSALT$3Sy1OLRk4kTa7P6fvzwp71)
